Your invoicing system knows when a sale becomes an invoice. Spain's Veri*Factu rules also call for
an invoice record with a **huella** (hash), a link to the preceding record, and a QR lookup URL.
You need to send the record to the AEAT, Spain's tax agency, and handle its response.

`@waitron/verifactu` gives your TypeScript code the protocol pieces: record construction,
hash chaining, validation, XML, QR payloads, and AEAT response parsing. Its API keeps no invoice
or chain state. You choose the database, numbering and invoice workflow, certificate-bearing HTTP
transport, and QR renderer.

Choose it when you already have an invoicing application and want to keep those choices. If you
need built-in series storage, record signing or QR images, [compare other starting points](/verifactu/en/start/introduction/)
before adopting this smaller protocol core.

```sh
npm install @waitron/verifactu
```

[Build a first record and send it to the local fake AEAT](/verifactu/en/start/getting-started/).
Then [connect your own storage and transport](/verifactu/en/guides/submit/).

This package helps you build a **SIF**, a deployed invoicing system. It is not a complete SIF by
itself. [Check what your system still has to do](/verifactu/en/start/not-a-sif/).
