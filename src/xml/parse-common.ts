/**
 * Shared parser configuration for every module here that reads XML —
 * parse-suministro.ts, parse-consulta.ts and parse-request.ts. Leaf values
 * stay strings — parseTagValue is off — so each parser converts specific
 * numeric fields explicitly via asNumber below.
 *
 * parseTagValue is deliberately off: flipping it to true would turn a literal
 * like "123.40" into the number 123.4 and "0012345678" into 12345678,
 * destroying literals on the reconciliation path. DatosRegistroFacturacion is
 * not diffed field by field — drain.ts compares Huella alone, deliberately —
 * but the values that locate a record there are matched as exact strings.
 *
 * trimValues is deliberately off too, for the identical reason: it is a
 * second, independent transformation of the same literals, applied whether or
 * not parseTagValue would also have mangled them. fast-xml-parser defaults
 * this to `true`, which would silently strip leading/trailing whitespace from
 * every leaf — including DatosRegistroFacturacion's stored literals — before
 * this library ever sees them. AEAT's SOAP responses are not pretty-printed
 * inside leaf content (any indentation whitespace lives between sibling
 * elements, which have no text of their own to trim), so there is no real
 * wire-format upside to trimming; there is only the downside of quietly
 * reformatting a value this path exists specifically not to reformat.
 *
 * removeNSPrefix strips namespace prefixes so `sfR:EstadoEnvio` and
 * `EstadoEnvio` both land on the same key — AEAT's prefixes are not
 * guaranteed stable across environments, and binding to them would make the
 * parser brittle.
